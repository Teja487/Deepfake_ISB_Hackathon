Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger technology that allows for secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant record-keeping. It operates on a network of computers, where each transaction is recorded in a "block" and linked chronologically to the previous one, forming a chain of blocks, hence the term "blockchain." This technology eliminates the need for intermediaries, such as banks or governments, by enabling peer-to-peer transactions that are verified through cryptographic algorithms. One of its key features is immutabilityâ€”once data is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered without altering all subsequent blocks, making it highly secure. Blockchain has broad applications, ranging from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to supply chain management, smart contracts, and decentralized finance (DeFi), revolutionizing how data and transactions are managed across industries.
